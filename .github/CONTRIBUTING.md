# BoostSRL Contributing Guidelines

Our goal is to push the boundaries of machine learning through open development and explainable approaches to decision-making. We believe that these are two of the best ways to create trustworthy systems that people can interract with in their daily lives.

Any suggestions or contributions which further this goal are welcome.

## How to ask a question?

Start with these steps:

1. Consult the [BoostSRL Wiki](https://github.com/boost-starai/BoostSRL/wiki/)
2. Check if the question has been asked previously by reviewing the [issues](https://github.com/boost-starai/BoostSRL/issues).

If your question is unanswered, decide if **email** or a **GitHub issue** is more applicable.

1. By email
  
  * Sriraam Natarajan (**Sriraam.Natarajan@utdallas.edu**): Questions about the algorithms, modes, or software.
  * Alexander L. Hayes (**Alexander.Hayes@utdallas.edu**): Wiki clarifications, corrections, or questions.

2. GitHub issues

  * Follow all directions in the issue template.
  * Ask a question that is direct and coherent

## How to file a bug report?

Start with development environment details:

1. Operating system (e.g. Windows 10 64-bit, macOS High Sierra, Fedora 24 Desktop).
2. Java version (`java -version` on Linux/macOS, [Windows instructions on java.com](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/version_manual.xml).)
3. BoostSRL version.
4. Were you using source code or a Jar file?
5. Which IDE were you using? (e.g. Eclipse, Visual Studio, GNU Emacs with the Jar)

Describe what you were doing that possibly led to the unexpected behavior.
